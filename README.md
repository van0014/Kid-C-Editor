# Kid-C-Editor

This is a level editor for the SEGA Genesis game 'Kid Chameleon'. Made with Game Maker 8. It relies on Saxman's .kcm file format. In my opinion, his excellent work created the Kid Chameleon modding community.

The tile picker companion program was compiled with ENIGMA, and therefore is small and fast.
The main program requires changes before it would work with ENIGMA, the ultimate IDE for this program to fascilitate contributors.
