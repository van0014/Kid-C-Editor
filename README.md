# Kid-C-Editor

This is a level editor for 'Kid Chameleon'. Made with Game Maker 8.
The tile picker companion program was compiled with ENIGMA, and therefore is small and fast.
The main program requires changes to work with ENIGMA, which would be the ultimate IDE for this program to fascilitate contributors.
